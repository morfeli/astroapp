The lunar orbit is elliptical and tilted with respect to Earth’s orbit, so we can only see up to 5 eclipses per year. Depending on the geometry of the Sun, Moon and Earth, the Sun can be totally blocked, or it can be partially blocked. There are three tpyes of solar eclipses, Total Solar, Annular Solar, and Partial Solar"

We know of at least 7,000 asteroids. The Asteroid Belt may contain many objects, but they are spread out over a huge area of space. This has allowed spacecraft to move through this region without hitting anything. Asteroids get their names from suggestions by their discoverers and are also given a number. The formation of Jupiter disrupted the formation of any worlds in the Asteroid Belt region by scattering asteroids away. This caused them to collide and break into smaller pieces. Gravitational influences can move asteroids out of the Belt. The Asteroid Belt is often referred to as the 'Main Belt' to distinguish it from other groups of asteroids such as the Lagrangians and Centaurs. The four largest asteroids in the belt are Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The Asteroid Belt is located in an area of space between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter."

It also is home to the known dwarf planets Pluto, Haumea and Makemake. The Kuiper Belt could contain hundreds of thousands of icy bodies that range in size from small chunks of ice to worldlets larger than 100 kilometres across. Astronomers have tracked most short-period comets from their origins in the Kuiper Belt. These are comets with orbital periods of 200 years or less. There could be more than a trillion comet nuclei in the main body of the Kuiper Belt."

Asteroids are mainly made of materials left over from the formation of the inner solar system words. Asteroids are clues to the formation of the rocky planets of our solar system.

Most of the objects come from asteroids, which are objects made of various types of rock and have existed since the origin of the solar system. A small rocky or metallic chunk of material that travels through space is called a meteoroid. Very small meteoroids (the size of dust) are often referred to as micrometeoroids or space dust. These fragments may also be leftover comet debris, or were ejected in collisions between other solar system bodies such as the Moon or Mars. As a meteoroid travels through our atmosphere, it is heated by friction. That causes it to glow, and if this happens at night, we see a long streak of light known as a meteor."

They are usually named for the constellation in which their radiant appears. The meteoroids in a shower usually come from the trail of debris left behind by a comet. In the case of the Geminids and Quadrantids, those meteor showers come from the debris scatted by orbiting asteroids. When Earth’s orbit intersects the dust trail, we see more meteors flaring as the cometary debris encounters our planet’s atmosphere."

They began their galactic dance over a few hundred million years ago and are currently in a period where their colliding gas clouds are bursting with new star formation. As the two galaxies merge, their gravitational interactions pull long tails of gas away from each other, and these tails are the sites of starburst activity. In a few billion years, the cores of these two galaxies will be combined into one large core, with a supermassive black hole at its heart. It will be surrounded by an elliptical galaxy of old stars."
